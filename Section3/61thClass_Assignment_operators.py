Assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable in Python. They are shorthand notations that combine the assignment operator (=) with some other arithmetic or bitwise operator.

Here are some examples of assignment operators:

+=: adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. 
For example, x += 2 is equivalent to x = x + 2.
-=: subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. 
For example, x -= 2 is equivalent to x = x - 2.
*=: multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand. 
For example, x *= 2 is equivalent to x = x * 2.
/=: divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand. 
For example, x /= 2 is equivalent to x = x / 2.
//=: performs floor division (integer division) on the left operand with the right operand 
and assigns the result to the left operand. For example, x //= 2 is equivalent to x = x // 2.
%=: takes the modulus of the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left 
operand. For example, x %= 2 is equivalent to x = x % 2.
**=: raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
For example, x **= 2 is equivalent to x = x ** 2.
&=: performs a bitwise AND operation on the left operand with the right operand and assigns
the result to the left operand. For example, x &= 2 is equivalent to x = x & 2.
|=: performs a bitwise OR operation on the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result
to the left operand. For example, x |= 2 is equivalent to x = x | 2.
^=: performs a bitwise XOR operation on the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result
to the left operand. For example, x ^= 2 is equivalent to x = x ^ 2.
Assignment operators are useful because they allow you to write shorter and more readable code. 
Instead of writing x = x + 2, you can write x += 2. This is especially useful when you need to increment or decrement a variable by a certain amount.
